# Airline Data Analysis

Three MapReduce programs that use Hadoop to analyze airline data from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr). Task 1 computes the average arrival delay of each airline. Task 2 calculates the average arrival delay of each route. Task 3 groups together the number of times and reasons that flights were canceled.
